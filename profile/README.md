# Our Mission: Driving Digital Transformation in Energy Research
NFDI4Energy aims to establish a sustainable, transparent, and reproducible research infrastructure for interdisciplinary energy systems research. Given the urgent need to transform energy systems toward net-zero greenhouse gas emissions, we face numerous new research challenges. These challenges are further intensified by the increasing complexity of systems, driven by new interconnections between energy sectors such as electricity, heat, and mobility. Research efforts towards these Cyber-Physical-Energy-Systems (CPES) heavily rely on modelling and (co-)simulation-based approaches. Tracking of models together with all data creates a complex software and data management challenge.

# The Community
NFDI4Energy is a community-driven initiative focused on addressing the digital needs of interdisciplinary energy systems research. The primary goal is to build an open ecosystem for FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) Research Artefacts in Energy Systems Research. NFDI4Energy supports the entire research and transfer cycle—from identifying relevant competencies and defining research scenarios to integrating models, publishing results, and identifying new research questions.

# The Research Services
A central component of NFDI4Energy is the development of an open and FAIR service portfolio that supports a wide range of workflows—from data collection to integration into research software. Our platform aims to enhance the traceability, reproducibility, and transparency of research outcomes for both the scientific community and society at large. Additionally, NFDI4Energy fosters collaboration between research institutions and industry partners while enabling greater societal engagement in research.
